                            I’m Danielle Neubauer - Bay Area implant, Israeli born & Tel Avivian at heart. Born to a family of farmers, my family left their farms in Israel to pursue a dream of sharing Israeli farming technologies with the world. Growing up, I spent 5 years in India, 3 in Zambia and a year and a half in Germany. Each of these places allowed me to view my identity from a different angle and here I am today guiding Cal students on navigating their own journey to understanding their identity. I’m privileged to wake up every morning with the opportunity and platform to impact students’ lives by having deep 1:1 conversations, facilitate discussions, hold events, lead trips to foreign countries and host speakers from all over the world and more. <br>
                            In my career as a community builder, I saw how the internet has shifted the way we interact and build community. I would like to use the tools I gain from the BootCamp to create an impact that extends far beyond my direct community.
